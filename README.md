A retail company wants to understand the spending
behaviour of its customers to target them with personalized
marketing campaigns. They have collected data on
customer demographics (age, gender) and spending habits
(annual income, spending score) and want to segment their
customers based on their spending behaviour. The
objective of this project is to build a customer segmentation
model to help the retail company in developing targeted
marketing strategies.
